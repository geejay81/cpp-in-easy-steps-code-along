# Handling Strings

[README](../README.md)

## Notes

- There is no native string data type in C++
- The <string> library class contains a string object that emulates a string data type
- The <string> library can be used in a program by using the #include directive at the start of the program, e.g.
``` cpp
#include <string>
```
- Once this library is included, a string variable can be declared in the same way as other data type variables
