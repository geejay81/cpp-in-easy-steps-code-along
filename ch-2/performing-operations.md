[README](../README.md)

## Notes

### Arithmetic
- Operators that can be used for arithmetic

| Operator  | Operation     |
|-----------|-----------    |
| +         | Addition      |
| -         | Subtraction   |
| *         | Multiplication|
| /         | Division      |
| %         | Modulus       |
| ++        | Increment     |
| --        | Decrement     |

- When using multiple operators in one command, parentheses can be used to make sure a section of the command is performed first
- Where there are multiple parentheses, the innermost parentheses are calculated first
- Increment and Decrement operators can be placed before or after the value...
    - if placed before the value, the value is immediately updated
    - if placed after the value, the value is first noted and then updated
