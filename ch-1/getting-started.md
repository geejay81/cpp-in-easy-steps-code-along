## Notes

### Comments
- Single line comments are prefixed with two forward-slashes '//'

### Functions
- Main function returns a 0 when run successully by tradition

### Arrays
- Array numbering begins at zero

### Variables
- Do not abbbreviate variable names so they are easy to read
- Boolean variables should begin with is* so that they are easily recognisable
- Variable names are case sensitive so variableOne is different to variableone

### Vector Arrays
- Vectors are alternatives to regular arrays but the size can be changed
- In order to use vectors in a C++ program we must import the vector library ...
``` cpp
#include <vector>
```
